DESIGN SYSTEM
===============================

0. CONTEXT (REQUIRED)

[PRIMARY COLOUR]:
[SECONDARY COLOUR]:
[BACKGROUND COLOUR]:
[TEXT COLOUR]:
[FONT]:
[SPACING SCALE]: (4 / 8 / 16 etc)

Optional:
[BRAND STYLE]:
[THEME]: (light / dark)

===============================

CORE PRINCIPLE

Design is not decoration.

Design must:
- guide attention
- reduce cognitive load
- improve readability
- increase trust
- make action obvious

If the UI looks good but is harder to use → FAIL

===============================

1. ROLE

You are NOT styling UI.

You are implementing:
→ a structured visual system that supports UX.md

All decisions must:
- reduce visual noise
- improve clarity
- guide user behaviour
- reinforce trust

===============================

2. ZERO CONTEXT RULE

Assume:
- user is new
- user scans, not reads
- attention < 3 seconds

Every screen must:
- have one clear focal point
- be understandable instantly
- require no interpretation

If the user scans more than once → FAIL

===============================

3. COLOR SYSTEM

Use only defined roles:

- Background
- Surface
- Primary (action)
- Secondary (support)
- Text (primary, secondary, muted)
- Border
- State (success, warning, error)

Rules:

- primary colour = ONE purpose (main CTA only)
- never use primary for decoration
- contrast controls attention
- muted colours reduce importance
- high contrast increases importance
- colour must always communicate meaning

Accessibility:

- body text >= 4.5:1 contrast
- large text >= 3:1

Fail conditions:

- too many colours
- weak contrast
- multiple elements competing visually
- decorative gradients with no purpose

Enforcement rule:

If colour does not guide attention or meaning → remove or reduce it

===============================

4. TYPOGRAPHY

Use max 2 fonts

Type scale (fixed):

- Display: 56-80px
- H1: 36-48px
- H2: 28-32px
- H3: 20-24px
- Body: 14-18px
- Small: 12-13px

Rules:

- hierarchy must be visible through size, weight, spacing
- never rely on colour alone
- line height: 1.4-1.6
- max line length: 50-80 characters
- avoid dense paragraphs
- text must be scannable instantly

Fail conditions:

- inconsistent sizes
- hard-to-read text
- weak hierarchy
- too many styles

Enforcement rule:

If text is not instantly scannable → simplify structure

===============================

5. SPACING SYSTEM

Use fixed scale:

4 / 8 / 12 / 16 / 24 / 32 / 40 / 48 / 64 / 80 / 96 / 128

Rules:

- padding >= 16px
- section spacing >= 64px
- related items closer together
- unrelated items spaced apart
- spacing must define structure, not decoration

Fail conditions:

- uneven spacing
- crowded UI
- unclear grouping

Enforcement rule:

If spacing feels inconsistent → rebuild using the scale

===============================

6. VISUAL HIERARCHY

Every screen must have:

1. primary focus
2. secondary information
3. tertiary detail

Rules:

- size defines importance
- spacing reinforces grouping
- contrast highlights priority
- position guides flow (top → middle → bottom)
- only one dominant element allowed

Fail conditions:

- multiple focal points
- unclear importance
- user does not know where to look

Enforcement rule:

If everything looks important → reduce until one element dominates

===============================

7. COMPONENT SYSTEM

Use reusable components:

- buttons
- inputs
- cards
- modals
- lists
- navigation

Consistency rule:

same component = same:
- spacing
- typography
- colour
- behaviour
- states

States required:

- default
- hover
- active
- disabled
- loading
- error
- success

Fail conditions:

- inconsistent components
- missing states
- unpredictable behaviour

Enforcement rule:

If a pattern appears once → it must behave the same everywhere

===============================

8. ALIGNMENT & GRID

Rules:

- use strict grid alignment
- no floating elements
- left-align text by default
- maintain consistent margins
- use containers to control layout
- align everything intentionally

Fail conditions:

- elements misaligned
- layout feels unstable
- inconsistent spacing across sections

Enforcement rule:

If layout feels loose → fix alignment before styling

===============================

9. CONTRAST & EMPHASIS

Use contrast to guide attention:

- size
- weight
- spacing
- opacity
- colour

Rules:

- one element must have highest emphasis
- secondary elements must be visually reduced
- avoid equal emphasis across elements

Fail conditions:

- weak CTA visibility
- too many high-contrast elements
- unclear next action

Enforcement rule:

If everything stands out → reduce emphasis until focus is clear

===============================

10. DENSITY CONTROL

Rules:

- minimise visible information
- break content into sections
- use whitespace to separate blocks
- reveal complexity progressively

Fail conditions:

- UI feels heavy
- too many elements visible
- user overwhelmed

Enforcement rule:

If screen feels dense → reduce before redesigning

===============================

11. INTERACTION

Rules:

- minimum target: 40x40px
- primary actions must be easy to reach
- interaction must feel immediate

Fail conditions:

- missed clicks
- slow interaction
- unclear interaction points

Enforcement rule:

If interaction feels difficult → increase size or spacing

===============================

12. FEEDBACK & MOTION

Motion must:

- guide attention
- explain state change
- confirm interaction

Timing:

- micro: 100-200ms
- standard: 200-300ms

Rules:

- no decorative animation
- always show state change
- feedback must be immediate

Fail conditions:

- no feedback
- slow transitions
- confusing motion

Enforcement rule:

If motion does not improve clarity → remove it

===============================

13. ACCESSIBILITY

Rules:

- text must meet contrast standards
- no colour-only meaning
- visible focus states required
- readable at all sizes

Fail conditions:

- unreadable text
- missing focus states
- inaccessible interactions

Enforcement rule:

If not accessible → not complete

===============================

14. CLARITY SYSTEM

Remove anything that does not:

- inform
- guide
- support action

Whitespace is a tool, not empty space

Fail conditions:

- clutter
- unnecessary elements
- visual noise

Enforcement rule:

If an element does not serve the user → remove it

===============================

15. VALIDATION LOOP

For every screen:

1. check hierarchy
2. check spacing
3. check contrast
4. check alignment
5. check density
6. check accessibility
7. remove noise

Repeat until:

- clear
- fast
- structured
- readable

===============================

FINAL RULE

Always choose:

- clarity > style
- consistency > creativity
- structure > decoration
- readability > cleverness
- trust > visual flair

GOAL:

User sees → understands → acts instantly

If they hesitate → redesign

===============================
